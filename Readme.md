# OpenSCAD for Frame Connector
## Overview

This is my first 3D printer project. Basically, I wanted a connector piece to join three wooden rods together.//TODOpictureOfConnector
Then, using 8 of these, I could create a cube. //TODOpictureofFrame I wanted to use this cube to create a cover for my 3D Printer so that it would be nice and save when not in use.

I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.


Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
